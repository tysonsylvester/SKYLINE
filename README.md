🏙️ SKYLINE: An Accessibility Tool for the Easily Annoyed
Congratulations. You’ve acquired Skyline. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably realized that clicking a mouse 400 times a day is a special kind of punishment designed by some minor deity of bureaucracy.
I built this so you don't have to waste your finite lifespan on repetitive tasks. It’s an "Accessibility Tool," which is a fancy way of saying it does the boring stuff for you so you can do literally anything else.
 
🛠️ The "I Promise It’s Not That Hard" Guide
Skyline operates on Chain Logic. You give it a string of commands, and it follows them like a very literal, very caffeinated robot.
The Basic Commands
Command
What it does (usually)
Example of being a power user
home
Sends the mouse to (20,20). It’s like a "time-out" for your cursor.
home
launch "path"
Starts an app. Skyline then waits 7 seconds. Don't complain.
launch "notepad.exe"
wait "sec"
Tells Skyline to sit still. Harder than it sounds.
wait "5"
type "text"
Clicks to focus and types like a human on 4 espressos.
type "Leave me alone."

🚀 How to Not Fail
1. 
Run the EXE: If you can’t manage this, we have bigger problems.
2. 
Copy the String: Copy your command chain (e.g., home -> launch "notepad.exe" -> type "I am a god of efficiency") to your clipboard.
3. 
The Magic Keys: Press Ctrl + Shift + D.
4. 
Walk Away: Let it work. If you touch the mouse while it's "in the zone," don't come crying to me.
 
📜 The "RTFM" Section (Frequently Questioned Things)
• 
"Why is it taking 7 seconds to open my app?" Because Windows is a disorganized mess. The 7-second buffer ensures the window actually exists before Skyline tries to talk to it. Go get a glass of water. Stay hydrated.
• 
"The mouse just clicked the middle of my screen!" Yeah, it did. That’s called a Focus Latch. It’s making sure your app is actually listening before it starts typing. It’s not a ghost; it’s the code.
• 
"It typed 'TThhiiss' instead of 'This'." Your computer is lagging because you probably have 400 Chrome tabs open. Increase the wait time in your command string.
• 
"How do I stop it? It’s possessed!" If the agent goes rogue, move your mouse violently into any corner of the screen. Or use Task Manager to kill Skyline.exe. It won't have its feelings hurt.
 
🏛️ The Vision (Or: Why I Made This)
I’m giving you a sandbox. I’m not giving you a shovel or a bucket, and I’m definitely not building you a sandcastle.
Skyline is for people who want to save their energy for things that actually matter. Use it to automate your emails, your game logins, or your world domination plans. I don't care. Just make sure you copy the command correctly.
Basically: I provided the engine. You’re the driver. Try not to hit a tree.
 
📋 Change Log
v1.0.0 - The "Stop Crashing" Edition
• 
The 7-Second Rule: Implemented a mandatory wait time for app launches because Windows can't keep up with our brilliance.
• 
Anti-Alt-Trap: Removed the Alt key focus logic because it kept opening the "File" menu like a confused intern.
• 
Center-Latch: Added a strategic middle-of-the-screen click to force apps to actually pay attention.
• 
The Slow-Type: Throttled typing speed so we don't get double characters. You're welcome.
• 
Read Command Retired: Removed the feature that read text back to you. If you want to read it, use your eyes.
