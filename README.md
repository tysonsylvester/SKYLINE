# 🏙️ SKYLINE

**I’m fed up.** I built this because I was bored and I was getting really, really annoyed. If you’re here, you’re probably just as tired as I am of clicking the same buttons every day until your soul dies. Skyline is a robot assistant I built to do the boring stuff so I can actually go live my life. It’s not "professional," it’s just me trying to make Windows behave for five minutes.

### 🛑 REALITY CHECK
**This might not work for you.** I’m being 100% honest: this took way too many tries to get right, and even now, it sometimes fails. This wasn't a "eureka" moment—it was me sitting here getting really bored and thinking, "Screw it, let's try something." 

On my machine? It’s a masterpiece. On yours? It might just look at your setup, decide "not today," and do absolutely nothing. If it breaks, don't be shocked. We're in this together.

### 🛠️ HOW IT WORKS
Skyline is a caffeinated assistant that lives in your clipboard. You give it a string of commands, and it tries its best to follow them like a very literal, very tired intern.

* **`home`** : Sends the mouse to the corner. It's a "time-out" for your cursor when it's being a brat.
* **`launch`** : Opens an app. It waits **7 seconds**. Why? Because Windows is a disorganized mess and it needs a minute to find its shoes. Don't complain about the wait; go get a drink.
* **`type`** : It clicks the middle of the screen (the "Focus Latch") to make sure the app is actually awake, and then it types. I slowed it down so it doesn't trip over its own feet.

### 🚀 HOW TO USE IT
1.  **Download the EXE.** It’s in the releases. If you can't find it, I can't help you.
2.  **Copy your "Chain."** Write it like: `home -> launch "notepad" -> type "I am finally free"`. Copy that to your clipboard.
3.  **The Magic Combo:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + D`. 
4.  **HANDS OFF!** Once you hit that combo, **stop touching the mouse.** If you fight the robot, you’re going to have a bad time.

### 📜 GET THIS SH*T OUT OF THE WAY (FAQ)
* **It's not doing anything.** Did you copy the command? Did you press the hotkey? I can't read your mind and neither can a 100-line Python script.
* **Why 7 seconds?** Because Windows needs time to register that a window exists. The 7 seconds is there so the script doesn't try to talk to a ghost. Deal with it.
* **It clicked the middle of my screen.** That’s the **Focus Latch**. If I don’t click the screen, it types into your browser instead of the app. It's not a ghost; it's the code.
* **It typed "TThhiiss" instead of "This."** Your computer is lagging because you have 400 Chrome tabs open. Close some tabs or increase the `wait` time.

### 🤝 IYKYK
The code is live. It looks like a crime scene because I spent my energy making it *work*, not making it *pretty*. I’m done with this for now. I solved my problem and I’m going to go find a new hobby for a week. 

**BUT...** if you post an "Issue" on GitHub with a crazy idea, there is a very high chance I'll see the notification, something will just *click* in my brain, and I’ll spend the next 72 hours straight fixing it for you. 

**If you know, you know.** If not? Well, it was fun while it lasted. I'm going to go do literally anything else.
